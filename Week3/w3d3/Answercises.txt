What is the difference between belongs_to and has_one?
a. The difference between belongs_to and has_one is that
   belongs_to is in the class which refers to the database table with the foreign key of the association
	 while
	 has_one is in the class which refers to the database table with the primary key of the association


Why would a belongs_to_many association not make sense, when a has_many does?
b. Because in order to belong_to_many you would have to have multiple id's written in your foreign key column.
